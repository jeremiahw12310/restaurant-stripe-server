# 🥤 Drink Type Randomizer - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**
Added a randomizer that determines whether a user should get a **Milk Tea**, **Fruit Tea**, or **Coffee** in their drink and includes this preference in the ChatGPT prompt for more varied and interesting combo suggestions.

## ✅ **What Was Implemented**

### **Step 1: Server-Side Randomizer**

#### **Updated Files:**
- `server.js` (main server)
- `backend/server.js` (development server)  
- `backend-deploy/server.js` (production server)

#### **Key Features Added:**
1. **Random Drink Type Selection**
   ```javascript
   const drinkTypes = ['Milk Tea', 'Fruit Tea', 'Coffee'];
   const randomDrinkType = drinkTypes[Math.floor(Math.random() * drinkTypes.length)];
   const drinkTypeText = `DRINK PREFERENCE: Please include a ${randomDrinkType} in this combo.`;
   ```

2. **Enhanced ChatGPT Prompt**
   - Updated the prompt to include the specific drink type preference
   - Changed from generic "any drink category" to specific drink type requirement
   - Added logging to track which drink type was selected

3. **Improved Logging**
   - Added `🥤 Selected Drink Type:` logging for debugging and monitoring
   - Shows which drink type was randomly selected for each request

### **Step 2: Prompt Enhancement**

#### **Before:**
```
3. One item from any drink category (like "Fruit Tea", "Milk Tea", "Coffee", "Lemonade/Soda", "Drink")
```

#### **After:**
```
3. One item from the drink category - DRINK PREFERENCE: Please include a [Milk Tea/Fruit Tea/Coffee] in this combo.
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Test Run Results:**
1. **Test 1**: Selected **Fruit Tea** → Got "Peach Strawberry" (Fruit Tea)
2. **Test 2**: Selected **Milk Tea** → Got "Bubble Milk Tea" (Milk Tea)  
3. **Test 3**: Selected **Milk Tea** → Got "Capped Thai Brown Sugar" (Milk Tea)
4. **Test 4**: Selected **Milk Tea** → Got "Bubble Milk Tea" (Milk Tea)

### **Variety Analysis:**
- ✅ **Drink types are being randomized correctly**
- ✅ **ChatGPT is following the drink preference instructions**
- ✅ **System maintains variety while respecting drink type constraints**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Randomization Logic:**
```javascript
// Drink type randomizer
const drinkTypes = ['Milk Tea', 'Fruit Tea', 'Coffee'];
const randomDrinkType = drinkTypes[Math.floor(Math.random() * drinkTypes.length)];
const drinkTypeText = `DRINK PREFERENCE: Please include a ${randomDrinkType} in this combo.`;
```

### **Prompt Integration:**
```javascript
IMPORTANT: You must choose items from the EXACT menu above. Do not make up items. Please create a personalized combo for ${userName} with:
1. One item from the "Dumplings" category (if available)
2. One item from any appetizer or side dish category (like "Appetizers", "Soups", "Pizza Dumplings", etc.)
3. One item from the drink category - ${drinkTypeText}
4. Optionally one sauce or condiment (from categories like "Sauces") - only if it complements the combo well
```

### **Logging Enhancement:**
```javascript
console.log('🥤 Selected Drink Type:', randomDrinkType);
```
