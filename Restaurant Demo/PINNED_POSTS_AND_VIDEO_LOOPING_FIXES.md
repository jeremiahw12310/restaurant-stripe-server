# üéØ Pinned Posts and Video Looping Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Pinned Posts Not Loading First Until Refresh**
**Problem**: Pinned posts were not appearing immediately when the feed loaded, requiring a manual refresh to see them.

**Root Cause**: The real-time listener was overriding the pinned posts during the initial load process, causing them to disappear until a refresh.

**Solution**: 
- **Fixed Real-time Listener Timing**: Ensured the real-time listener only starts AFTER the initial load is complete
- **Added Loading State Check**: Real-time listener now only updates pinned posts when `loadingState == .loaded`
- **Preserved Initial Pinned Posts**: Added logic to prevent real-time updates from overriding pinned posts during initial load
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track when pinned posts are loaded and updated

**Code Changes**:
```swift
// In fetchNextPageOfRegularPosts()
// FIXED: Set up listener for real-time updates ONLY AFTER initial data is loaded
if self.listener == nil {
    print("üîÑ Setting up real-time listener after initial load...")
    self.setupRealTimeListener()
}

// In setupRealTimeListener()
// FIXED: Only update pinned posts if we have them and initial load is complete
if !sortedPinnedPosts.isEmpty && self.loadingState == .loaded {
    self.pinnedPosts = sortedPinnedPosts
    print("üìå Pinned posts updated via real-time: \(sortedPinnedPosts.count)")
} else if !sortedPinnedPosts.isEmpty {
    print("üìå Skipping pinned posts update - initial load not complete")
}
```

**Result**: Pinned posts now appear immediately when the feed loads, no refresh required.

### 2. **Video Looping Implementation**
**Problem**: Videos were not looping continuously and lacked proper playback controls.

**Solution**: 
- **Implemented Video Looping**: Videos now loop continuously until paused, scrolled away from, or moved to another tab
- **Enhanced Playback Controls**: Added proper pause/play functionality
- **Automatic Loop Restart**: Videos automatically restart from the beginning when they reach the end
- **Lifecycle Management**: Videos stop playing when the view disappears or app goes to background
- **Notification System**: Added `stopAllVideos` notification for global video control

**Code Changes**:
```swift
// Video looping implementation
@objc private func playerItemDidReachEnd() {
    // Loop video - restart from beginning
    player?.seek(to: .zero)
    if isPlaying {
        player?.play()
        print("üîÑ Video looped - restarting playback")
    }
}

// Enhanced video cleanup
private func stopVideoPlayback() {
    // Stop the video and prevent looping
    player?.pause()
    player?.seek(to: .zero)
    player = nil
    isPlaying = false
    isExpanded = false
    print("‚èπÔ∏è Video playback stopped")
}

// Lifecycle management
.onDisappear {
    // Stop video when view disappears
    stopVideoPlayback()
}
.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification)) { _ in
    // Stop video when app goes to background
    stopVideoPlayback()
}
.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .stopAllVideos)) { _ in
    // Stop video when requested (e.g., when navigating away from community)
    stopVideoPlayback()
}
```

**Result**: Videos now loop continuously with proper controls and stop when appropriate.

## üîß **Technical Improvements**

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Reduced Real-time Listener Frequency**: Lowered from 25 to 15 posts for better energy efficiency
- **Optimized Pinned Posts Loading**: Limited to 2 pinned posts to reduce data load
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error recovery and user feedback
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of video resources to prevent memory leaks

### **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Immediate Pinned Posts Display**: No more waiting for refresh
- **Smooth Video Looping**: Seamless continuous playback
- **Intelligent Video Control**: Videos stop when navigating away or switching tabs
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring

## üéâ **Final Results**

### **‚úÖ What Works Now**
1. **Pinned Posts**: Appear immediately when feed loads, no refresh needed
2. **Video Looping**: Videos loop continuously until user interaction
3. **Video Controls**: Proper pause/play functionality
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Videos stop when appropriate (navigation, background, etc.)
5. **Performance**: Optimized for energy efficiency and smooth operation

### **üîß Production Ready**
- **No UI Changes**: All fixes are internal logic improvements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and logging
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper resource cleanup and management
- **Scalable**: Optimized for large-scale usage with reduced data loads

## üì± **Testing Instructions**

1. **Pinned Posts Test**:
   - Load the community feed
   - Pinned posts should appear immediately at the top
   - No refresh should be required

2. **Video Looping Test**:
   - Tap play on a video post
   - Video should start playing and loop continuously
   - Tap pause to stop the loop
   - Navigate away from the feed - video should stop
   - Switch to another tab - video should stop

3. **Performance Test**:
   - Scroll through the feed smoothly
   - Check that videos don't continue playing in background
   - Verify pinned posts remain visible during scrolling
