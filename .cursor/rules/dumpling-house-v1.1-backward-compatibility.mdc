# Dumpling House v1.1 – Backward compatibility

This project is **version 1.1 of the Dumpling House app**. Apply this rule to every change.

## Requirement

- **All changes must be backward-compatible** and must not break or alter functionality currently used in the live production version.
- **Existing features, data structures, and user flows** must continue to work exactly as they do now unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## When implementing

1. **APIs and server:** Add new query params, endpoints, or response fields only in an additive way. Do not remove or change existing params, response shapes, or behavior when old clients or callers are used.
2. **Client:** New behavior (e.g. new query params) should be opt-in or conditional so current production builds keep working against updated servers.
3. **Data / Firestore:** No schema or document changes that break existing reads/writes. New indexes or optional fields are fine.
4. **Plans:** In any plan or design doc, include a short “Backward compatibility” section stating how the change preserves existing behavior.

When in doubt, prefer additive, optional behavior and fallbacks (e.g. server falls back to old path if new path fails) so production keeps working.
