# ðŸ”§ Firebase ADC Setup for Render (Organization Policy Workaround)

## Problem
Your organization has policies that prevent creating service account keys. The error message "Key creation is not allowed on this service account" indicates this restriction.

## Solution
We'll use Application Default Credentials (ADC) with a workaround that creates the service account file during the build process.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Get Your Firebase Service Account Key (Alternative Method)

Since you can't create keys through the Firebase Console, try these alternatives:

#### Option A: Use Existing Service Account
1. **Check if you already have a service account key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Navigate to IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts
   - Look for existing service accounts for your project
   - Check if any have existing keys

#### Option B: Contact Your Organization Admin
1. **Request a service account key:**
   - Contact your IT/security team
   - Explain you need Firebase Admin SDK access for your restaurant app
   - Request a temporary exception or existing key

#### Option C: Use a Different Google Account
1. **Try with a personal Google account:**
   - Create a new Firebase project with a personal Google account
   - Generate the service account key there
   - Use that for development/testing

### 2. Configure Render Environment Variables

Once you have the service account key JSON:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Find your service: `restaurant-stripe-server`

2. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Go to "Environment" tab
   - Add/update these variables:

   **Key:** `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
   **Value:** Copy the ENTIRE contents of the service account JSON file

   **Key:** `FIREBASE_AUTH_TYPE`
   **Value:** `adc`

   **Key:** `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`
   **Value:** `dumplinghouseapp`

### 3. How the Workaround Works

The build script (`build.sh`) will:
1. Take the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variable
2. Create a `service-account.json` file during build
3. Set up Application Default Credentials to use this file
4. Your app will authenticate with Firebase using ADC

### 4. Test the Deployment

After setting up the environment variables:

1. **Trigger a new deployment:**
   - Go to your Render service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

2. **Check the logs:**
   - Look for "âœ… Service account file created" in build logs
   - Look for "âœ… Firebase Admin initialized with Application Default Credentials"

3. **Test the health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://restaurant-stripe-server-1.onrender.com/
   ```
   Should show: `"firebaseConfigured":true`

## Alternative Solutions

### If You Still Can't Get a Service Account Key:

#### Option 1: Use Firebase Emulator (Development)
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Start emulators locally
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

#### Option 2: Use a Different Database
- Switch to a different database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Update the server code accordingly

#### Option 3: Contact Organization Admin
- Request policy exception for this specific project
- Provide business justification for Firebase access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Key creation is not allowed"**
   - Solution: Use the workaround above or contact admin

2. **"Firebase not configured"**
   - Check that `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is set correctly
   - Verify the JSON content is complete

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Ensure the service account has Firestore Admin permissions
   - Check project ID matches

## Security Notes

- The service account key is encrypted in Render's environment
- The key file is created temporarily during build
- Never commit the key to your repository
- The key only has the permissions needed for your app

## Next Steps

1. Try to get a service account key using one of the methods above
2. Set up the environment variables in Render
3. Deploy and test
4. If still having issues, consider the alternative solutions
