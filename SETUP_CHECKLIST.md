# Receipt Scanning Setup Checklist ✅

## Backend Server Status
- ✅ **Server Running**: Backend server is running on port 3001
- ✅ **Dependencies Installed**: All required packages (express, multer, cors, openai, dotenv)
- ✅ **Uploads Directory**: `/backend/uploads/` exists with proper permissions
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: `/analyze-receipt` endpoint is configured
- ✅ **CORS Enabled**: Cross-origin requests are allowed
- ✅ **File Upload**: Multer configured for image uploads
- ✅ **Deployment Ready**: Procfile and package.json configured for cloud deployment

## iOS App Configuration
- ✅ **Camera Permissions**: `NSCameraUsageDescription` set in Info.plist
- ✅ **Network Access**: App can make HTTP requests to any URL
- ✅ **Camera Interface**: Custom camera view with receipt guide overlay
- ✅ **Image Processing**: Direct upload to backend without cropping
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- ✅ **Environment Config**: Easy switching between local and production

## Environment Configuration
- ✅ **Config.swift**: Centralized configuration for all environments
- ✅ **Local Development**: `http://localhost:3001` (simulator)
- ✅ **Local Network**: `http://10.37.129.2:3001` (physical device)
- ✅ **Production**: `https://your-app.railway.app` (deployed)
- ✅ **Easy Switching**: Change `currentEnvironment` in Config.swift

## Camera Features
- ✅ **Live Preview**: Real-time camera feed with black background
- ✅ **Receipt Guide**: White rectangle (280x350) for vertical receipts
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shows "Setting up camera..." while initializing
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Retry buttons and clear error messages
- ✅ **Capture Button**: Large, easy-to-tap white capture button
- ✅ **Cancel Option**: Easy way to exit camera view

## User Experience
- ✅ **Simple Workflow**: Camera → Position receipt → Capture → Processing
- ✅ **Visual Guidance**: Clear instructions and receipt positioning guide
- ✅ **Processing Feedback**: Shows progress while AI analyzes receipt
- ✅ **Success Display**: Congratulations screen with points earned
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry options

## Technical Implementation
- ✅ **AVFoundation**: Proper camera session management
- ✅ **SwiftUI Integration**: Seamless integration with app navigation
- ✅ **State Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
- ✅ **Network Requests**: Multipart form data upload to backend
- ✅ **JSON Parsing**: Proper handling of AI response data
- ✅ **Environment Switching**: Easy configuration management

## Backend Integration
- ✅ **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4 Vision for receipt analysis
- ✅ **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding for AI analysis
- ✅ **Response Format**: JSON with orderNumber, orderTotal, orderDate
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and logging
- ✅ **File Cleanup**: Temporary files are deleted after processing
- ✅ **Cloud Ready**: Configured for deployment to Railway/Render/Heroku

## Deployment Status
- ⏳ **Local Development**: ✅ Working
- ⏳ **Production Deployment**: Ready to deploy (see DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- ⏳ **Environment Variables**: Need to set OPENAI_API_KEY on deployment platform

## Testing Status
- ✅ **Server Connectivity**: Backend responds to requests
- ✅ **Camera Permissions**: App requests camera access properly
- ✅ **File Upload**: Uploads directory is writable
- ✅ **Network Requests**: iOS app can reach configured URLs
- ✅ **Environment Config**: Easy switching between environments

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start backend server (local development)
./start-backend.sh

# Or manually:
cd backend && node server.js

# Test server connectivity
curl http://localhost:3001
```

## Environment Switching
To switch environments, edit `Config.swift`:

```swift
// For local development (simulator)
static let currentEnvironment: Environment = .local

// For local development (physical device)
static let currentEnvironment: Environment = .localNetwork

// For production (deployed app)
static let currentEnvironment: Environment = .production
```

## Expected User Flow
1. User taps "Scan Receipt" button
2. Camera opens with receipt guide overlay
3. User positions receipt in white rectangle
4. User taps capture button
5. Image uploads to backend for AI analysis
6. AI extracts receipt data (total, date, order number)
7. User sees congratulations screen with points earned
8. Points are added to user's account

## Troubleshooting
- **White Screen**: Camera is initializing, wait for "Setting up camera..." to disappear
- **Permission Denied**: Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera > Restaurant Demo
- **Server Not Found**: Check Config.swift environment setting
- **Upload Failed**: Verify backend URL in Config.swift
- **Production Issues**: Check deployment platform logs

## Next Steps for Production
1. Choose deployment platform (Railway/Render/Heroku)
2. Follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
3. Update `productionBackendURL` in Config.swift
4. Set `currentEnvironment = .production`
5. Test on physical device

## Environment Variables Needed
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for receipt analysis
